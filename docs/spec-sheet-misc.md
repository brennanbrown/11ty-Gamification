## Additional Notes

* The blog should be colourful! There should be gradients throughout.
* Typeface is key, use a really nice serif font from Google Fonts
* Also include traditional blogging features like tags, categories, and search, etc.
* Make a small script so that tags are each assigned a random unique color!
* Utlize Tailwind for CSS

## Important!

* Please ensure you additionally implement tests and unit tests throughout the project and refer to them after finishing each step.
