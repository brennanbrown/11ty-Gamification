Tags should help future me find ideas fast. My approach:

- Prefer a small, consistent set of tags over many one-offs.
- Use topic + intent: e.g., `badges`, `testing`, `writing`, `process`.
- Add new tags only when a post wouldn’t fit existing ones.

This keeps tag pages meaningful and the tags index browsable.
