IndieGarden is my experiment to make daily writing feel like play. I wanted a flow that rewards consistency, shows progress visibly, and stays simple enough to maintain.

What this site focuses on:

- Clear feedback: badges for streaks and word counts, a calendar heatmap, and per-post stats.
- Lean tooling: Eleventy for static builds and a small data pipeline for analysis.
- Pragmatic testing: integration tests that mirror real builds, so regressions are caught early.

Roadmap highlights:

- Smarter badges (e.g., weekly goals, topic streaks).
- Better search and tag discovery.
- Lightweight writing prompts when I’m stuck.

If you’re reading this: welcome! The garden grows with each small post.
