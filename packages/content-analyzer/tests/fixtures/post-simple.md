# Morning Reflections

Today I wrote a little about my plans. It's nothing fancy—just thoughts.

- Make coffee
- Read a chapter of a book
- Write at least 750 words

```js
// code blocks should be ignored for word counting
const msg = 'Hello, world!';
console.log(msg);
```

In the afternoon, I walked to the café. Café au lait is my favorite. It’s been a productive day.
